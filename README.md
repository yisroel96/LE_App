CODEMENTOR DESCRIPTION CodeMentor is a Rails-based web app that allows software engineers to sign up and match with a student who is looking to learn to code. Mentors can add open source materials to create a custom curriculum for their student, and get them started on their coding journey.

INSTALL AND USAGE INSTRUCTIONS To use CodeMentor, fork and clone the repository. CD to the local repository files, run bundle install, and then run rails s from the terminal. In your web browser, navigate to the appropriate localhost, and sign up to either be a mentor or a student. If you are signing up as a mentor, your profile will appear to new students who are looking for someone to mentor them. If you sign up as a student, navigate to Find a Mentor to pick your mentor.
